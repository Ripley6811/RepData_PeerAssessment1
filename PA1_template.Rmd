# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
# Read csv data from local zip file.
act = read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
str(act)

# Convert strings in "date"" column to date objects.
act$date = as.Date(as.character(act$date))
str(act)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
act.cc = act[complete.cases(act),]

hist(sapply(split(act.cc, act.cc$date), function(x) sum(x$steps, na.rm=TRUE)))

hist(sapply(split(act.cc, act.cc$date), function(x) mean(x$steps, na.rm=TRUE)))
```
